def process_elements_for_docs(client: Any, code_elements: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Processes code elements by generating explanations and docstrings for each.
    
    Iterates through a list of code elements and enhances each by adding 'explanation' and 
    'docstring' fields. Only processes functions, methods, and classes; skips other element types.
    Respects API rate limits with built-in delays between requests.

    Args:
        client: Client object used to interact with the documentation generation API.
        code_elements: List of dictionaries representing code elements to process. Each 
            dictionary should contain 'type', 'name', and 'file_path' keys at minimum.

    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, Any]]: The modified input list with added 'explanation' and 'docstring' 
            keys for each processed element. Unprocessed elements will have these keys set to None.

    Note:
        Currently processes these element types: function, method, async function, 
        async method, and class. All other types are skipped.
