def process_elements_for_docs(client: Any, code_elements: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Processes code elements to generate explanations and docstrings for documentation.

    Iterates through a list of code elements (functions, methods, classes) and adds
    'explanation' and 'docstring' fields to each element's dictionary. Skips elements
    that don't require documentation (based on type or other criteria).

    Args:
        client: Client object used to generate explanations and docstrings.
        code_elements: List of dictionaries representing code elements to process.
            Each dictionary must contain 'type', 'name', and 'file_path' keys.

    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, Any]]: The modified input list with added 'explanation' and
        'docstring' keys for each processed element. Unprocessed elements will have
        these values set to None.

    Notes:
        - Processes only elements of type: function, method, async function, async method, or class
        - Adds rate limiting delays between API calls to comply with usage limits
        - Prints progress information during processing
